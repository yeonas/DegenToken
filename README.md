# DegenToken Smart Contract

## Overview

The `DegenToken` contract is an ERC20 token integrated with a simple in-game item redemption system. Players can mint tokens, transfer tokens, burn tokens, and redeem tokens for in-game items. The contract is designed to work within a gaming ecosystem, where tokens serve as the currency for acquiring various game items. The system supports a list of pre-defined game items with different costs and allows players to redeem tokens for these items.
